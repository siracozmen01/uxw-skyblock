/**
 * The orders a vessel's crew placed at the ports' markets, and the trade they add up to.
 *
 * <p>An order is a saga between the vessel's hold, written here under the vessel's lease, and the island
 * bank, which answers a keyed move once. Every state an order passes through is written before the next
 * step is taken:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A sale takes the goods out of the hold and records the order {@link State#OWED} in one
 *       transaction. The bank then pays, and the order is {@link State#DONE}.</li>
 *   <li>A purchase is recorded {@link State#PAYING}. The bank is paid, and the goods go into the hold with
 *       the order {@link State#DONE} in one transaction. A bank that refuses ends it {@link State#CANCELLED};
 *       a hold with no room for what was paid for has it {@link State#REFUNDING} and then
 *       {@link State#REFUNDED}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The trade a vessel did and its standing in the port grow with an order as its goods move.
