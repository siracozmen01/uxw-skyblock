/**
 * Fires what the operator wrote for an interaction, through the family's action engine.
 *
 * <p>The context is wired all the way rather than partly. A player is the subject and the target
 * audience, so {@code [message]}, {@code [title]}, {@code [actionbar]} and {@code [sound]} have
 * somebody to reach: a context without one renders every line and drops it, quietly. The item store
 * is the player's own inventory, because the engine's default answers "none" to every item question
 * and a {@code [take-item]} against it refuses, quietly and wrongly.
 *
 * <p>{@code [bossbar]} needs a delay to take its bar down again. A node with a scheduler wires one.
 * A node without hears about it the first time such a line runs, which is the engine's own way of
 * saying so and better than a bar that never goes away.
 *
 * <p>An operand is read through the family's standard operands, so {@code {if=%player_level% >= 10}}
 * compares a level rather than the text of the token. {@code [take-money]} and {@code [give-money]}
 * reach the server's economy through Vault when it is there. {@code [console]} and {@code [player]}
 * run their command: left unwired, the first two read every balance as zero and the last two ran
 * nothing, and none of it said so.
