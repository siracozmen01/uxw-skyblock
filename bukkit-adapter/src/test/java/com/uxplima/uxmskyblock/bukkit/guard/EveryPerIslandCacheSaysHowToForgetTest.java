/**
 * Every service that keeps something per island says how to forget one, and says it to the wiring.
 *
 * <p>An island id is a fresh uuid every time, so a cache that keeps an erased island never gives a
 * wrong answer. It simply never lets go. A server that has made a hundred thousand islands over a
 * year was carrying a hundred thousand material indexes, and a material index is a count per
 * material.
 *
 * <p>Several of these services were written with a method to forget an island and nothing ever
 * called it. This checks the other half: that the wiring says so out loud.
